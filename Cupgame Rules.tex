\section{Introduction}
\subsection{History and Motivation}
\textit{The Cup Game} originated as a nonsensical competitive cup-stacking game played by members of the CMS Cross Country Team at the Hoch Shanahan Dining Commons. While the exact time and circumstances of its origin were not documented, most estimates a time somewhere in the early 2010's during the hay day of team dining. General popularity of \textit{The Cup Game} has fallen in recent years but it remains an integral part of the team experience while eating at the Hoch. As of 2022, \textit{The Cup Game} has been appropriated by other students at Harvey Mudd College who play their own variations from the canonical \textit{Cup Game}. While the importance and overall goal of participating in \textit{The Cup Game} are largely up for personal interpretation, the most fundamental objective is to stack your cup on that of another participant in an action known as cupping. Due to the subtle nature of cupping an opponent, disagreements are all too frequent without the existence of a formal set of \textit{The Cup Game} rules. Members on \textit{The Cup Game} Board have thus convened to draft and ratify a formal specification to shift the focus of \textit{The Cup Game} away from petty disputes over these ambiguities and towards competitive gameplay.

\subsection{How to Use This Document}
This document is multi-purpose. It is guide, a constitution and a documentation of history. Those who are new to \textit{The Cup Game} are encouraged to read it cover-to-cover, referencing the section on terminology (\ref{section:terminology}) when necessary. When one wishes to settle ambiguities in gameplay or a dispute over the rules, they may cite the gameplay section (\ref{section:gameplay}). In the inevitable circumstance that this book does not clearly settle disputed gameplay, participants are encouraged to extend the rulebook with oversight from the cup game committee. In order to maintain an account of the rich and epic history of this game, the authors of this document are also allowed to provide accounts of landmark events in \textit{The Cup Game}'s evolution through time.

\section{Gameplay Overview}
\label{section:gameplay}
\subsection{Cupping} Cupping is the elementary action in \textit{The Cup Game}. It is essential that every player understands the circumstances under which valid cupping takes place, which are fortunately quite simple. A player in possession of a stack can only cup a viable opponent in possession of a viable stack. If these conditions are not met and a cup is attempted, the violating player must take back their stack.

The top cup on a player's stack must also be empty in order for the cupping action to take place. If this condition is not met and a cup is attempted, the violating player must empty the contents of their cup (either through consumption or by throwing it away) and place their opponents stack on top of their own cup.

A player becomes active either when they make their first cupping attempt or when an opponent successfully cups them. Once a player is active, they may not refill the top cup on their stack above the line, nor may they deposit their stack in the dish conveyer and return to their table. They may only exit \textit{The Cup Game} by successfully cupping an opponent or by forfeiting through cup duty.
\subsection{Defensive Actions}
\subsubsection{Defensive Undercupping}\label{section:defensive_undercupping} Defensive undercupping as a method of cupping an opponent who is attempting an offensive cup. Its primary advantage is that in defensive circumstances, it allows a player to cup another player without becoming active themselves. It is also relatively infrequently practiced, meaning offensive cuppers are less likely to anticipate a defensive undercup. The gameplay of an undercup is as follows: a player in the act of being cupped can yell ``undercup'', after which they thrust their cup upward into the base of the stack of the offensive cupper. There must be a clear cupping attempt on behalf of the cupper in order for this sequence to be valid. The undercupper must also clearly move their cup upward and cannot simply initiate an undercup verbally. If there was no clear cupping attempt on behalf of the offensive party, then the undercup manoeuver is considered offensive and will make the undercupper active.   
\subsubsection{Traditional Abstinence} Many Hoch goers find \textit{The Cup Game} a great inconvenience to their gustatory pleasures in the Commons. They look for a means of enjoying the company of their Cross Country friends without game-induced anxiety or the fear of embarrassing themselves in front of other socially-inept NARPs.

Abstinence can be practiced which protects a viable but inactive player from being cupped under all circumstances. Traditional abstinence is performed by placing the empty cup on any one of its nine sides before becoming active as a player.

It is encouraged that active game participants not berate those who choose abstinence. Those practicing abstinence should be aware, however, that these actions do have inevitable social implications (See \ref{section:social}).
\subsubsection{Cubing Abstinence}  Cubing is an excellent solution to this that has been adopted into the formal set of the game's rules in order to promote a more inclusive eating culture alongside game participants.

To cube, simply fill a cup with enough ice such that the level is above the line. A finished drink will never be viable, as there is always ice obstructing a legal cup. This makes cubing a safer means of abstinence; there is no period during which the cup is viable.
\subsection{Personal Biases} Players are required to dissociate personal biases from their game play whenever in competition with a \textit{viable} opponent. A \textit{viable} opponent is defined as someone who

Those who are attentive and committed to \textit{The Cup Game}, sacrificing the tranquil atmosphere of their meal, usually perform best. Those who are negligent generally perform poorly.
\subsection{Miscellaneous Gameplay}
\subsubsection{Thunder God} a player in possession of a stack of two or more cups can perform the Thunder God ritual to reduce their stack size by one cup. This action may only be used once per game. In order to Thunder God, a player with more than one cup in their stack must first stand on their table and yell ``I am the Thunder God'' such that the phrase is audible to every other person eating in the Hoch. Following this, they must blow down the gap in between the top two cups on their stack hard enough for the top cup to float completely out of the stack (ie. there must be no overlap between the top and second cups in the stack). In this moment, the player grabs the top cup out of the air and discards the cup.

\subsubsection{Offensive undercupping} As discussed in \ref{section:defensive_undercupping}, offensive undercupping is the act of undercupping without a clear offensive attack on behalf of the cupped party. Historically, the difference between defensive and offensive undercupping is one of the most highly disputed distinctions in the game. It is therefore considered an advanced and ineffective tactic for beginner players.

\subsection{Terminology}\label{section:terminology}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{abstinence}---abstaining from \textit{The Cup Game} by putting your cup down before becoming active
    \item \textit{active} (player)---a player who has entered \textit{The Cup Game}
    \item \textit{board}---the advisory board of \textit{The Cup Game}, tasked with interpreting legislation, revising the rule book, and settling disputes
    \item \textit{cup} [n.]---a nonagonal cup from the Hoch (\ref{fig:cup})
    \item \textit{cup} [v.]---the act of placing your stack on another opponent's stack, thus relieving you of cup duty
    \item \textit{cup duty}---when a stack's owner puts their stack in the dish conveyer, removing the cups out of game play and terminating the owner's session on a loss
    \item \textit{cupping attempt}---any attempt to offensively cup an opponent. Defensive undercupping is not a form of cupping attempt
    \item \textit{cubing}---A form of cup game abstinence that involves filling your cup with ice above the line
    \item \textit{empty} (cup)---a cup used during a meal that now only contains liquid residue. Any solids obstructing the line invalidate the empty status
    \item \textit{loss}---when a stack's owner chooses to perform cup duty and leaves the Hoch
    \item \textit{the line}---the protrusions around half way up the inside of a cup (\ref{fig:line})
    \item \textit{the game}---slang for \textit{The Cup Game}, not to be confused with \textit{The Game} (Fuck, I just lost the game)
    \item \textit{the Hoch}---The Hoch Shanahan Dining Commons
    \item \textit{the rulebook}---this book
    \item \textit{stack}---any nonzero number of cups stacked on their lines. Note that a stack of size one and a cup are effectively the same thing. In these definitions and in general speak, we use `cup' if and only if the object is a singular cup.
    \item \textit{undercupping}---defensively or offensively cupping a viable opponent's stack by thrusting your cup beneath theirs
    \item \textit{viable} (stack)---any time that the liquid level in the top cup of a stack is below the line, which makes it eligible for cupping
    \item \textit{viable} (opponent) --- someone who who can be cupped when their stack is viable, when they
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item are in the Hoch
              \item are consuming a beverage out of one of the Hoch's nonagonal cups
              \item have a basic understanding of \textit{The Cup Game} rules, to the point which they have the capacity to cup without violating rules outlined in Cupping and Defensive Actions
          \end{enumerate}
    \item \textit{win}---when a stack's owner cups an opponent

\section{Settling Disputes}
The proliferation and complexity of disputes in the Game necessitate a dedicated protocol and committee to deal with them in an efficient and unbiased manner. The highest order of legislation is of course this rulebook, but in the case of unforeseen circumstances or semantic inconsistencies, these rules establish a means to amending the original rule set to reflect the needs of an ever-changing constituent.
\subsection{Types of Disputes}
We categorize disputes by the intention of the parties involved, the nature of the disputed action, and the level of response that is necessary on behalf of the advisory board
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Petty disputes---these types of disputes are clearly resolved by rules in this book and should be interpretable by any lay reader. However, many of these disputes arise to reverse the outcome of gameplay by a frustrated player and therefore require a single member of the advisory board to dictate the ruling of the dispute.
    \item Misunderstandings---these types of disputes arise when a player does not understand the rules, resulting in a genuine conflict between players over some action. These types of disputes can also be resolved by reading the rules directly. Since they result from genuine misunderstandings, it is recommended that the players consult the rule book first before appealing to a board member for a settlement.
    \item Aggravated disputes---arising in any situation in which members of the game are put in imminent danger at the hands of an enraged player of the game. The rule book's legislation is almost always irrelevant in these disputes. Instead, members of the advisory board must intervene to physically diffuse the situation.
    \item Novel disputes---arising from any situation in which the rulebook does not clearly determine the legality of certain gameplay. In these cases, a cup game board meeting is necessary and legislation may be revised.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Consulting the Rules}
If you find yourself needing to consult the rulebook, either to inform yourself on gameplay or to settle a dispute, you will find that the rulebook is both a fun cover-to-cover read and an easy-to-navigate document complete with a searchable PDF outline and hyperlink references. All game-specific vocabulary is documented in \ref{section:terminology}, but if clarifications in the text are needed, do not hesitate to bring a request for addendum to an advisory board member.

When consulting the rules in the event of a dispute, it is recommended that you cite directly from the text. There should be no extended interpretations of this book, since it was written with the intent of being a literal prescription of rules.

In its small format, these rules should be portable and can be carried by a holder in the Hoch. If you are so inclined, feel free to print out the original copy, found \href{https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hpick/Cupgame%20Rules.pdf}{here}. Counterfeits can always be checked against this online copy.
